# Web Scraping and Visualizing Bitcoin Data 

## About The Project
**This is a simple program and one of my first attempts at web scraping data using REST APIs, in this case 'CoinGecko' to scrape cryptocurrency data. It was 
completed as part of my course, 'Python for Data Science, AI, and Development', offered by IBM. The program employs the special python module, PyCoinGecko, 
to extract Bitcoin data from CoinGecko, a popular platform for reporting cryptocurrency prices, charts, and crypto market data. It also utilizes Python's 
powerful graphing library, plotly, in order to visualize the Bitcoin data extracted. Overall, this program examines the bitcoin prices in US dollars over 
the last 90 days to date, and visualizes the changes in Bitcoin prices over time using a candlestick chart.**

As usual, I have attached two versions of the program, the first is the raw Python code whilst the second is a Jupyter Notebook version, which renders the code 
viewable in a more organized, user-friendly format and allows the user to view and/or interact with the code to reproduce the results.

## Quick Access
**You can quickly access the program from either of the links below. Both links will immediately direct you to the Jupyter notebook version with all the code 
and output organized into separate sections and cells, rendered and ready for viewing. The first link allows you to view the input code and corresponding output 
but without interacting with it. The second link allows you to both view the code and resulting output and to execute the code in order to reproduce the results 
yourself. Note however to execute any part of the program, first you will have run the first two cells in the notebook in order to install and import the Python 
libraries to be used for this program.**
